# X. Statement of Confidentiality

Your {child’s} participation in this research is confidential. To make sure that your {child’s} participation remains confidential, your {child’s} data will be identified by a code number, and only the person(s) in charge will have access to the materials that link your {child’s} name and contact information to the code number. Data will be kept on computers that are controlled by a password and are located in a locked laboratory room.

Any photographs taken will be stored on a digital camera. Videos will either be recorded directly onto the computer that is collecting brain activity or on a digital video camera. Only approved laboratory staff will have access to the recordings or photographs. Recordings and photographs will be labeled by code number or the date and time of the recording. The computer files and videos will be marked with a code number or date and will be stored on a computer in a locked laboratory room.

Data may be shared with other researchers in a digital data library for an indefinite period. You will be asked separately whether you give permission for us to share in a secure digital library material from your {child's} participation such as video recordings, photographs, and images; other information such as your {child's} age, birth date, sex, ethnicity, education, and any health information reported to us; and information supplied by researchers who analyze data from this session.

Your {child's} data will be identified by a code number, not by name. No one in the data library will have access to the materials that link your {child's} name and contact information to your <child's> code number. You need not agree to share your data in the data library. Refusing to do so has no bearing on your participation, course credit, or compensation for your {child's} participation.

An exception to these protections of confidentiality concerns child abuse. Should a researcher witness an episode of abuse or suspect child abuse, the researcher will report to Dr. __________. Please note that investigators are obligated by ethical standards to report to the appropriate agencies any concerns for a child’s well being.

The Office of Human Research Protections in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, The Penn State University Office for Research Protections, and The Penn State University Institutional Review Board (IRB) may review records related to this project.
