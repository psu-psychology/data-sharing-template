# data-sharing-template

Template research consent and protocol language for data sharing.

Researchers at Penn State who wish to store and share data via Databrary may need to make modifications to their protocols. One approach is to use the Databrary release template <https://databrary.org/access/policies/release-template.html> along with modifications to the consent document's Statement of Confidentiality section and the HRP-591 Protocol document, sections 8 and 10. See below for examples of the latter two.

- Suggested consent language based on Rick Gilmore's active protocol, [gilmore-consent-statement-of-confidentiality.md](gilmore-consent-statement-of-confidentiality.md)
- Suggested language from Rick Gilmore's active EEG/behavior protocol. [gilmore-hrp-591-protocol.md](gilmore-hrp-591-protocol.md).
