# 8.0 Data and Specimen Banking For Future Undetermined Research

## 8.1 Data and/or specimens being stored

This study intends to store identifiable data (video recordings that may include faces and voices) and de- identified EEG and behavioral data.

## 8.2 Location of storage

Data will be stored in a web-based data library called Databrary (http://databrary.org).

## 8.3 Duration of storage

Data will be stored indefinitely.

## 8.4 Access to data and/or specimens

All data will be stored on Databrary for archival purposes. Identifiable data (video recordings, full birth and test dates) will only be shared with other authorized Databrary researchers if participants have given explicit written permission (adults) or assent with parent permission (minors). De-identified data (EEG, behavior) may be shared with other authorized Databrary researchers without explicit written permission.

## 8.5 Procedures to release data or specimens

Only researchers authorized by Databrary, who have signed an agreement (http://databrary.org/user- guide/policies/investigator-agreement.html) pledging to protect confidentiality and privacy of research participants and not to identify or contact participants if they are re-identified, will be allowed access to shared identifiable and de-identified data on Databrary. The agreement must also be signed by an authorized researcher's institution. For more information about Databrary policies in this regard see (http://databrary.org/user-guide/getting-authorized.html).
The PI will decide whether and when to release any data for sharing with the restricted set of Databrary authorized investigators.

## 8.6 Process for returning results

The PI will have information about who accesses shared data from the Databrary system, but will not otherwise monitor data use or re-use. If the PI suspects that data have been misused in some way, the PI will contact Databrary and ask it to investigate.

# 10.0 Confidentiality,Privacy and DataManagement

## 10.1 Confidentiality

Answers to screening questions, some of which may involve health status, are not written down and thus not recorded. The pre-test vision results are recorded on a spreadsheet that does not contain identifiable information. Testing results, both EEG and behavioral, are recorded electronically. No names, addresses, phone numbers or email addresses are contained within the data files themselves, nor is there identifiable information in any filenames.

Identifiable data (names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, and birthdates) from child participants may be recorded on a separate recruiting spreadsheet that is stored locally on a password- protected computer in the locked laboratory room, 449 Moore.

Identifiable information (names via signature) are recorded on our consent, assent, and Databrary release documents in written form. These documents are filed in a locked filing cabinet that is located in 120 Chandlee or in 449 Moore.

Only authorized laboratory staff with card swipe authorization have access to 120 Chandlee. Only research staff under the supervision of the PI have access to 449 Moore.

### 10.1.1 Identifiers associated with data and/or specimens

EEG and behavioral data may contain dates of birth and date at test or age at test. Video recordings may contain faces and voices.

#### 10.1.1.1 Use of Codes, Master List

We use the session date and time (e.g., 2014-08-26-1430) as a unique file/participant identifier for our electronic files. Our recruiting spreadsheet contains the scheduled session date and time for infant and child participants.
The Psychology Department's subject pool website contains names and contact information for participants, but we do not record those data elements.

### 10.1.2 Storage of Data and/or Specimens

Videos are collected on digital cameras. The files are transferred to password-protected computers and assigned the date/time session code as a filename. The cameras are kept in locked rooms. Files on the cameras are deleted as storage limits require. All other electronic files are collected on computers that are password protected, and the files are stored locally or on cloud servers (Google Drive, Box) under password-protected accounts, with access limited only to those research staff the PI authorizes. Electronic data (identifiable and de-identified) will be stored indefinitely in the Databrary digital library. Identifiable data collected as part of the recruiting process will be destroyed annually. Paper records (consent/assent, Databrary release) will be destroyed at the end of the grant period.

### 10.1.3 Access to Data and/or Specimens

Access to data will be permitted only to i) laboratory staff under the direct supervision and training of the PI, and ii) authorized investigators with Databrary accounts, as described previously, subject to the sharing permission given by research participants.

### 10.1.4 Transferring Data and/or Specimens

See section 8.0.
